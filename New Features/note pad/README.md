# 1. Problem

It's generally desirable for admins to be able to take notes while making changes to the menus.

# 2. Solution
There are surely many options, but after a quick google search I found the [quill react component](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill). This module is very well documented, and it looks like this:

The idea being that we can easily implement this module with advice from the designers on how it should be organized. It may be possible to have the editor as an overlay as well (unclear if this is actually possible).

It would be worth asking the team that does the editing of the menus what style would be most beneficial to productivity.
