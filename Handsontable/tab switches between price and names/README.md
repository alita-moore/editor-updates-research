# 1. Problem

It's very slow to change multiple item values and rows within a given set of values; for example the rows in the 'addons' section

If you wanted to rapidly reset all of the values it would take you a long time to change each one individually

# 2. Solution

An integrated react table would solve this because it allows for tabbing to the next value as well as easy editing.
