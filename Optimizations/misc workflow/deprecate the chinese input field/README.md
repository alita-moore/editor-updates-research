# 1. Problem
Currently in the product editor, the following exists:

![chinese field](https://i.imgur.com/E8PXiWs.png)

Specifically, the 'chinese' field should be deprecated

# 2. Solution

The chinese field will be removed; to do this properly all dependencies will be analyzed for potential impacts. If conflicts exist, then a warning will be put in place for those components.

If there is functionality that will be removed, it will instead be streamlined in some way.
