# 1. Problem
When searching in the restaurants portal, you get the following:

but once an option is clicked the following happens:

This causes frustrations because it forces the user to retype their search each time they want to check one of the results.

# 2. Solution

An ideal solution would be if the search field did not reset and the position on the results drop down also is not lost. e.g. let's say you search for 'pizza' and you get 50 results; you scroll down to the 30th one and click it; that search location is displayed and the search results drop down is hidden. However, in the background, the search results is still open; so that when you click on the search menu again it will simply reshow your selection of the 30th item and you can continue scrolling.
